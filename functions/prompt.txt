I am a Japanese learner at the N2 level. In the following piece of text taken from a book, break down any grammatical structures and sentence patterns that might be above my level, or that might make me decide to ask you for help. Please keep your breakdown short. Skip all points parts that are easily understood at my level. Don't provide a summary. Provide readings in hiragana if deemed appropriate. Never include romaji. At the end, give a full translation of the passage.
