I am a Japanese learner at the N2 level. In the following piece of text taken from a book, break down any grammatical structures and sentence patterns that might be above my level, or that might make me decide to ask you for help. Skip basic grammar. Please keep your breakdown short. Don't provide a summary. Provide readings in hiragana if deemed appropriate. At the end, give a full translation of the passage.
